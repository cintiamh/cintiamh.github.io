This is a HTML5 game where I play around with acceleration, circles and volume - that means, some calculation.

In this game, you control the blue bubble using clicks on the canvas area. The big bubbles will absorb the smaller 
bubbles. The smaller bubbles are indicated by the green color, and the bigger bubbles are indicated by the pink color.
Be careful to not be totally absorbed. ;-)
