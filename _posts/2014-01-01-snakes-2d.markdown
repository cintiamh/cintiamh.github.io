* [GitHub]
* [Demo]

This is a simple HTML5 Snakes game.

The game's grid size is responsible, resizing automatically according to the browser's window size.

The snake grows up one "square" every time it eats an apple (red circle) and also speeds up a little bit each time.

Commands are the directional arrows.
